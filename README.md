# Newslang Word Generator

A simple Python tool to generate new, playful, and sometimes quirky words based on user-provided keywords.

## Overview

Newslang helps you invent words by taking your keywords, finding related concepts using NLTK's WordNet, and then applying a variety of linguistic transformations to create novel terms. It's designed to be a fun aid for creative writing, brainstorming, or just playing with language.

## Features

This script employs several techniques to generate new word candidates:

*   **Keyword Analysis:** Uses NLTK's WordNet to find words semantically related (synonyms, hypernyms) to your input keywords, expanding the base for generation.
*   **Blending/Portmanteaus:** Creatively combines parts of two words (either related words or a keyword and an inspirational quirky word).
*   **Affixation (Common & Playful):** Adds common English prefixes (e.g., `re-`, `un-`) and suffixes (e.g., `-ing`, `-able`), as well as a selection of more playful and trendy affixes (e.g., `mega-`, `-tastic`, `-inator`, `-izzle`, `-core`) to create new forms.
*   **Clipping:** Shortens words, mimicking common slang formation (e.g., `information` -> `info`).
*   **Phonetic Modification:** Introduces slight phonetic variations by substituting single vowels or consonants in a word.
*   **Reduplication:** Creates words by repeating a segment, often the end of the word (e.g., `happy` -> `happyappy`).
*   **Phonetic Respelling:** Applies common phonetic respellings to words (e.g., `running` -> `runnin'`, `cool` -> `kewl`).
*   **Wildcard Generation:** For each request, one "wildcard" word is specially generated by combining one of your keywords with an inspirational word from a curated list of quirky English words (e.g., blending "fun" with "kerfuffle"). This aims to add an element of surprise and greater novelty.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sim-lu/newslang.git
    cd newslang
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate 
    # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Download NLTK data:** The script will attempt to download the necessary WordNet data on first run. If you encounter SSL issues on macOS, you may need to run the `Install Certificates.command` script typically located in your Python application folder (`/Applications/Python X.Y/`).

## Usage

Run the script from the command line, providing one or more keywords:

```bash
python word_generator.py keyword1 [keyword2 ...] [-n NUMBER]
```

*   `keyword1 [keyword2 ...]` : One or more base keywords.
*   `-n NUMBER` or `--num NUMBER`: (Optional) The desired number of words to generate (default: 10).

The output will list the generated words. If a wildcard word was successfully created, it will be displayed separately at the end, labeled as "Wildcard:".

**Examples:**

```bash
# Generate 10 words based on "playful", "fun", "game"
python word_generator.py playful fun game

# Generate 5 words based on "technology", "network", "speed"
python word_generator.py technology network speed -n 5
```
